<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 
<p align="left">
 <p> The basic idea for the project was to give the user a better experience with menus in restaurants.
 I chose webXR because it is an experience where downloading an application would go against the principle of facilitating the user experience. 8th Wall was a natural choice, for its practicality and speed, being easily integrated with a-frame and other web technologies.
 </p>
 
  <h3>Challenges</h3
   <p>
2D UI vs 3D environment is always a challenging issue working with AR. In the end, I learned and understood better how to use touch events and how, from a user's experience point of view, to better integrate the UI experience with 3D objects.
